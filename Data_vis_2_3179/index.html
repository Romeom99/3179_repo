                    Brazil, home to the largest rainforest in the world, and has the largest amount of area
                    covered in Primary rainforest. These rainforests however have been under threat in recent
                    history, through natural and unatural circumstances. As is stands Brazil is slowly losing 
                    its beautiful flora, that has become a symbol of the country. <br>
                    <br>
                    Each state in Brazil has seen its fair share of deforestation, especially in the northwestern 
                    states, where the largest chunck of  the Amazon lies. Below you can see the deforestation rates
                    for each state over the years 
                </p>

                    Brazil compared to the world, on average is the largest contributer to deforestation of
                    natural rainforests. Even when comparing to the relative area of rainforests that each country has
                    Brazil still comes out on top. <br>
                    <br>
                    Below you can see a chart showing the trend of deforestation of different countries compared
                    to Brazil. Each value has been normalised to the relative area of rainforests of that country
                </p>

                    Besides the unatural factors causing deforestation, there is another major factors
                    affecting the rainforests in Brazil. Wildfires are a big factor affecting, with Brazil
                    having thousands of spots fires per year. <br>

                    Below you can see the frequency of wildfires and where they appeared throughout Brazil
