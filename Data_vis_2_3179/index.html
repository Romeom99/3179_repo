            <h2>Comparing Brazil to other Countries</h2>
                <p>
                    Brazil compared to the world, on average, is the largest contributer to deforestation of
                    natural rainforests. Even when comparing to the relative area of rainforests that each country has,
                    Brazil still comes out on top. <br>
                
                    Below you can see a chart showing the trend of deforestation of different countries compared
                    to Brazil. Each value has been normalised to the relative area of rainforests of that country.
                    You will notice that when considering Brazil's large forest area, it does not fair that much different
                    to the other top countries in deforestation. Have a closer look at the actual quantity at each point.

            <h2>Causes of Deforestation</h2>
                <p>
                    The causes for deforestation in Brazil, stem down to mainly man made deforestation. These types of 
                    deforestation come from <span class="one">Commidity driven deforestation</span>, <span class="two">Foresty</span>,
                    <span class="three">Shifting agriculture</span> and <span class="four">Urbanisation</span>. Together these categories make up the vast
                    majority of deforestation in Brazil. There is another major factor as well which is <span class="five">Wildfires</span>,
                    which will be shown in greater lengths further down in this document. The below graph shows the total
                    amount of tree loss (square kilometer) that has occurred in Brazil from each of the causes. Below that, you can
                    create a bar chart for your chosen year ranges.

                    <span class="sincol"><p>
                        Wildfires throughout the Amazon, though not as big as a cause when compared to others,
                        is still something to be weary of. In the Amazon there are countless spot fires throughout
                        the year, some years even stemming into the thousands.<br><br> Wildfires do not occur naturally in
                        a tropical climate such as Brazil, leading to most of them being started by people, particulary 
                        farmers clearing trees, to make more room for their farm. <br><br>Below you can see a map of Brazil
                        which will show you the location and number of fires in a certain area. To polulate the map 
                        simply select one of the years on the line graph below it. Notice the shear number of fires there are 
                        in one year. Zoom in for a better look.

            <h2>Deforestation between states</h2>
                <p>
                    There are 27 states in Brazil. Each state has had its fair share of deforestation over the years.
                    No matter the size of the state or the amount of forest area they have, they all have some form 
                    of deforestation. Over the years this has been very constistent, with each state having steady rates.
                    <br><br>
                    Below you can see a heat map outlining the amount of tree loss each state has, with some states suchs as Rondonia
                    experiencing larger rates. These values below have all been normalised to the area of each state and shows how much square kilometer loss of 
                    forest per 100 kilometers squared of area for each state
